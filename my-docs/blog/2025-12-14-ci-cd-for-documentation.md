Modern documentation projects benefit greatly from CI/CD pipelines.

In this project, GitHub Actions is used to:
- validate documentation builds on pull requests
- generate OpenAPI-based API documentation
- automatically deploy the site to GitHub Pages

This workflow ensures that documentation changes are reviewed,
tested, and deployed with the same rigor as application code.
